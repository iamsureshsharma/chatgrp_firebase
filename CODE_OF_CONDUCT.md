# Gossipy Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers of the Gossipy project, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being respectful:** Treat everyone with respect and empathy. Disagreements and constructive criticism are welcome but should be expressed in a respectful manner.
- **Inclusive language:** Use inclusive language that welcomes and respects people of all backgrounds and identities.
- **Being supportive:** Be supportive of each other's contributions, both big and small.
- **Respect diversity:** Recognize and embrace the diversity of our community. We welcome people from all backgrounds and walks of life.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- **Harassment and discrimination:** Harassment and discrimination of any form will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, or other personal attributes.
- **Trolling and derogatory comments:** Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks are not welcome.
- **Unwelcome sexual attention:** Inappropriate advances, comments, or messages are not acceptable.
- **Bullying and intimidation:** Any form of bullying, intimidation, or retaliation will not be tolerated.
- **Spam and unwanted marketing:** Unsolicited advertising and spamming are not allowed in our community.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project maintainers at [joshimansi32@gmail.com]. All reports will be kept confidential. In cases where the reporter is personally involved, we will take measures to respect your privacy.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be addressed by project maintainers, who will take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to:

- Warning the offender.
- Temporary or permanent removal from the project community.
- Contacting law enforcement in the case of illegal activity.

Project maintainers may choose not to act on complaints that they believe do not violate this Code of Conduct or are not severe enough to warrant further action.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html).

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all. Contributors to this project are expected to adhere to these guidelines, and project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove contributors who do not follow the Code of Conduct.

Thank you for helping make the Gossipy project a welcoming and friendly space for all contributors.
